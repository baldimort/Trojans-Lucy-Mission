  abstract = {The Trojan asteroids provide a unique perspective on the history of Solar System. As a large population of small bodies, they record important gravitational interactions and dynamical evolution of the Solar System. In the past decade, significant advances have been made in understanding physical properties, and there has been a revolution in thinking about the origin of Trojans. The ice and organics generally presumed to be a significant part of Trojan compositions have yet to be detected directly, though low density of the binary system Patroclus (and possibly low density of the binary/moonlet system Hektor) is consistent with an interior ice component. By contrast, fine-grained silicates that appear to be similar to cometary silicates in composition have been detected, and a color bimodality may indicate distinct compositional groups among the Trojans. Whereas Trojans had traditionally been thought to have formed near 5 AU, a new paradigm has developed in which the Trojans formed in the proto-Kuiper Belt, and they were scattered inward and captured in the Trojan swarms as a result of resonant interactions of the giant planets. Whereas the orbital and population distributions of current Trojans are consistent with this origin scenario, there are significant differences between current physical properties of Trojans and those of Kuiper Belt objects. These differences may be indicative of surface modification due to the inward migration of objects that became the Trojans, but understanding of appropriate modification mechanisms is poor and would benefit from additional laboratory studies. Many open questions remain, and the future promises significant strides in our understanding of Trojans. The time is ripe for a spacecraft mission to the Trojans, to turn these objects into geologic worlds that can be studied in detail to unravel their complex history.},

  abstract = {Jupiter Trojans are thought to be survivors of a much larger population of planetesimals that existed in the planetary region when planets formed. They can provide important constraints on the mass and properties of the planetesimal disk, and its dispersal during planet migration. Here, we tested a possibility that the Trojans were captured during the early dynamical instability among the outer planets (aka the Nice model), when the semimajor axis of Jupiter was changing as a result of scattering encounters with an ice giant. The capture occurs in this model when Jupiter's orbit and its Lagrange points become radially displaced in a scattering event and fall into a region populated by planetesimals (that previously evolved from their natal transplanetary disk to 5 AU during the instability). Our numerical simulations of the new capture model, hereafter jump capture , satisfactorily reproduce the orbital distribution of the Trojans and their total mass. The jump capture is potentially capable of explaining the observed asymmetry in the number of leading and trailing Trojans. We find that the capture probability is (6-8) \texttimes{} 10 \textendash{}7 for each particle in the original transplanetary disk, implying that the disk contained (3-4) \texttimes{} 10 7 planetesimals with absolute magnitude H $<$ 9 (corresponding to diameter D = 80 km for a 7\% albedo). The disk mass inferred from this work, M disk 14-28 M Earth , is consistent with the mass deduced from recent dynamical simulations of the planetary instability.},

  title = {Capture of {{Trojan Asteroids}} in the {{Early Solar Nebula}}},
  volume = {33},
  abstract = {Planetesimals scattered onto high eccentricity orbits by Jupiter experienced very severe energy dissipation due to gas drag from the solar nebula. Numerical modeling shows that this damping can alter some orbits rapidly enough to prevent subsequent encounters with the planet. A small but significant fraction ($<$8\%) of scattered planetesimals find safe harbor on horseshoe and tadpole orbits in 1:1 resonance with the planet. Capture of these Trojan precursors depends strongly on the mass and orbital eccentricity of the planet as well as the planetesimal masses. A 10 Earth-mass protoplanetary core is much more efficient at capturing planetesimals into 1:1 resonance than a full-size 318
Earth-mass Jupiter---all other parameters being equal. Because small planetesimals experience a stronger drag force than larger bodies, after the initial scattering event they evolve more rapidly and are thus better protected from a second planetary encounter. Thus small bodies have a greater chance at becoming permanently trapped into 1:1 resonance than larger bodies do. For high planetary orbital eccentricities (e$>$0.2), a number of interesting features appear. First, capture probabilities into the 1:1 resonance appear to be an increasing function of planetary eccentricity. In additon, with high planetary eccentricity, nearly all scattered planetesimals are trapped in or evolve into L5 tadpole orbits that trail the planet, as was noted by Peale (1993). Finally, we find examples of direct capture into distant
pseudo-satellite orbits of the planet (for e$>$0.15). These strange orbits circle both the planet and the Sun with Jupiter's 12 year period, and may be the precurors of the planet's large population of irregular satellites.},

Initially, we approximate the system by the planar circular restricted three-body problem and assume small Trojan libration amplitudes. Employing an adiabatic invariant calculation, we show that Jupiter's thirty-fold growth from a \$10 M\_$\backslash$oplus\$ core to its present mass causes the libration amplitudes of Trojan asteroids to shrink by a factor of about 2.5 to \$$\backslash$sim 40\%\$ of their original size. The calculation also shows that Jupiter's radial migration has comparatively little effect on the Trojans; inward migration from 6.2 to 5.2 AU causes an increase in Trojan libration amplitudes of \$$\backslash$sim4\%\$. In each case, the area enclosed by small tadpole orbits, if made dimensionless by using Jupiter's semimajor axis, is approximately conserved. Similar adiabatic invariant calculations for inclined and eccentric Trojans show that Jupiter's mass growth leaves the asteroid's eccentricities and inclinations essentially unchanged, while one AU of inward migration causes an increase in both of these quantities by \$$\backslash$sim 4\%\$. Numerical integrations confirm and extend these analytic results. We demonstrate that our predictions remain valid for Trojans with small libration amplitudes even when the asteroids have low, but},

We summarize Gaia DR1 and provide illustrations of the scientific quality of the data, followed by a discussion of the limitations due to the preliminary nature of this release. Gaia DR1 consists of: a primary astrometric data set which contains the positions, parallaxes, and mean proper motions for about 2 million of the brightest stars in common with the Hipparcos and Tycho-2 catalogues and a secondary astrometric data set containing the positions for an additional 1.1 billion sources. The second component is the photometric data set,consisting of mean G-band magnitudes for all sources. The G-band light curves and the characteristics of \textasciitilde{}3000 Cepheid and RR Lyrae stars, observed at high cadence around the south ecliptic pole, form the third component. For the primary astrometric data set the typical uncertainty is about 0.3 mas for the positions and parallaxes, and about 1 mas/yr for the proper motions. A systematic component of \textasciitilde{}0.3 mas should be added to the parallax uncertainties. For the subset of \textasciitilde{}94000 Hipparcos stars in the primary data set, the proper motions are much more precise at about 0.06 mas/yr. For the secondary astrometric data set, the typical uncertainty of the positions is \textasciitilde{}10 mas. The median uncertainties on the mean G-band magnitudes range from the mmag level to \textasciitilde{}0.03 mag over the magnitude range 5 to 20.7. Gaia DR1 represents a major advance in the mapping of the heavens and the availability of basic stellar data that underpin observational astrophysics. Nevertheless, the very preliminary nature of this first Gaia data release does lead to a number of important limitations to the data quality which should be carefully considered before drawing conclusions from the data.},

In this paper we first review a classical method by C.F. Gauss to compute a preliminary orbit for asteroids. This method, followed by a least squares fit to improve the orbit, still today gives successful results when we have at least three separate observations. Then we introduce the basics of a very recent orbit determination theory, that has been thought just to be used with modern sets of data. These data allow us in many cases to know the angular position and velocity of an asteroid at a given time, even though the radial distance and velocity (r, r\textperiodcentered), needed to compute its full orbit, are unknown. The variables (r, r\textperiodcentered) can be constrained to a compact set, that we call the admissible region (AR), whose definition requires that the body belongs to the Solar System, that it is not a satellite of the Earth, and that it is not a ``shooting star'' (i.e. very close and very small). We provide a mathematical description of the AR: its topological properties are surprisingly simple, in fact it turns out that the AR cannot have more than two connected components. A sampling of the AR can be performed by means of a Delaunay triangulation; a finite number of six-parameter sets of initial conditions are thus defined, with each node of the triangulation representing a possible orbit (a virtual asteroid).},

Seven chords across Patroclus yielded an elliptical limb fit of 124.6 by 98.2 km. There were six chords across Menoetius that yielded an elliptical limb fit of 117.2 by 93.0 km. There were three sites that got chords on both objects. At the time of the occultation we measured a separation of 664.6 km (0.247 arcsec) and a position angle for Menoetius of 265$\smwhtcircle$. 7 measured eastward from J2000 north. Combining this occultation data with previous light curve data, the axial ratios of both objects are 1.3 : 1.21 : 1, indicative of a mostly oblate ellipsoid with a slight asymmetry in its equatorial projection. The oblate shape is not an equilibrium shape for the current rotation period, but would be if it were rotating with an $\sim$8 h period. This faster period is consistent with a pre-evolved state of the system with an orbital separation that is 50\% smaller. Our best estimate of the system density is 0.88 g cm-3.},

  abstract = {The Trojan population consists of two swarms of asteroids following the same orbit as Jupiter and located at the L4 and L5 stable Lagrange points of the Jupiter-Sun system (leading and following Jupiter by 60$^\circ$). The asteroid 617Patroclus is the only known binary Trojan. The orbit of this double system was hitherto unknown. Here we report that the components, separated by 680km, move around the system's centre of mass, describing a roughly circular orbit. Using this orbital
information, combined with thermal measurements to estimate the size of the components, we derive a very low density of 0.8 - 0.1 + 0.2gcm-3. The components of 617Patroclus are therefore very porous or composed mostly of water ice, suggesting that they could have been formed in the outer part of the Solar System.},

  title = {Spectroscopic {{Search}} for {{Water Ice}} on {{Jovian Trojan Asteroids}}},
  volume = {38},
  abstract = {We are conducting a systematic study of the Jovian Trojans using the Subaru 8-m, UKIRT 4-m and IRTF 3-m telescopes atop Mauna Kea, Hawaii. Theoretical models show that the Jovian Trojans formed beyond the snow-line and they may contain considerable amounts of water ice. We seek spectroscopic evidence for this pristine ice.

Object (4709) Ennomos has a geometric albedo of 0.13+/-0.02, which is significantly above the mean Trojan albedo of 0.041+/- 0.002 (Fernandez et al., 2003). An intriguing possibility is that the albedo of Ennomos is high because a recent impact has coated part of the surface with freshly excavated ice. We obtained near-IR (0.8-2.5 micron) spectra of (4709) Ennomos in search of the 1.5 and 2.0

micron bands of water ice. Four other Trojans, (911) Agamemnon, (617) Patroclus, (1143) Odysseus and (2797) Teucer, were also observed. These objects have been reported to show possible weak absorptions at 1.7 and 2.3 micron respectively (Emery and Brown, 2003). All five targets appear spectrally featureless, even in our

highest signal-to-noise ratio data. We present the data and a simple model consisting of mixtures of water ice and a spectrally featureless material, to quantify the limits to surface ice.},
